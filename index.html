                <p>She-Hulk, aka Jennifer Walters, is one of my favorite Marvel superheroes because she exhibits both intelligence and strength. There is a duality about her that I relate to: in her human form, she is shy and unassertive, but as She-Hulk, she gains self-confidence in addition to strength, while still regaining her intellect (unlike the Hulk). She is a strong leader who has been a member of multiple superhero teams (including the Avengers and the Fantastic Four), as well as a lawyer who advocates for the underprivileged. Her stories can be a lot of fun, thanks to her humor and frequent habit of breaking the fourth wall.</p>
